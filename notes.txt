-Vertex buffer object:
	Can store vertices on the GPU in its memory.

-glGenBuffers(glsizeisize, gluint *buffer):
	Will assign an integer id to the buffer.
	Size is how many buffers you want...?

-glBindBuffer(type, buffer):
	activates a certain buffer for the state machine? 

-glVertexAttribPointer:
	what does this do exactly?

-glEnableVertexAttribArray(int index):
        Also unsure


-Drawing with multiple VAOs, VBOs:
	 It makes more sense to use an array of these actually
